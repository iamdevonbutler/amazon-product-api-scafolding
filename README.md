# Amazon product api scafolding

Scafolding to do stuff w/ the amazon product api.

It uses [the Node.js client for the Amazon Product Advertising API](https://github.com/t3chnoboy/amazon-product-api) and
[Koa JS](https://github.com/koajs/koa).

All you gotta do is add some Amazon api keys and you're off to the races kid.
